# LightBox: Interactive Path Tracing with Three.js

**LightBox** is a simple and interactive path tracing renderer built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [`three-gpu-pathtracer`](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-gpu-pathtracer). This project visually demonstrates how light rays behave in a 3D scene—bouncing, scattering, and casting soft shadows—through real-time path tracing.

---

## ✨ Features

- Realistic soft shadows and global illumination
- Reflective material to showcase light bouncing
- Dynamic sample-based rendering that gets smoother over time
- Interactive camera control (OrbitControls)
- Scene composed of:
  - Two walls and a floor
  - A reflective object in the center
  - A light source emitting rays

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This mini project was created for a Computer Graphics course to help understand how the **Path Tracing Algorithm** works in 3D graphics and how it differs from traditional rasterization or ray tracing.

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [three-gpu-pathtracer](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-gpu-pathtracer)
- JavaScript (ES6)
- WebGL
